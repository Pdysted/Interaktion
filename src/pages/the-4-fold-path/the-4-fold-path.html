  <br>
  The questions and structure is developed from a practice called The 4 Fold Path.<br>
  A practice developed by Art of Hosting practioners, and is thought of as a way to teach people to change in intelligent ways.
  <br><br>
  <b>A Conscious Practice</b><br>
  Being truly present, engaging skillfully in conversations, being a good host of conversations and enganging with others in co-creation are all skills that are easily understood, 
  but takes continuous practice to hone.
  <br><br>
  And that is the purpose of this app: To help you maintain a conscious practice and enchance your skills. 
  <br><br>
  <b>Building Capacity</b><br>
  As we learn to be truly present and engage in conversations that really matter, we become learners.
  <br><br> 
  As learners many doors are open to us.
  As we begin to host conversations and connect with others, we become a community of learners.
  <br><br> 
  As a community we hold a bigger capacity than as individuals. In this way a community becomes 'a community that learns', and here we enter collective intelligence.
  <br><br>
  We multiply our capacity and enter the field of emergence - the center of our true power.
